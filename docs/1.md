Focusing on packet capturing using the `pnet` library in Rust can provide a deep dive into the subject. Below is a refined tutorial outline along with some code snippets specifically for this topic.

# Tutorial: Packet Capturing Using `pnet` in Rust

## Introduction
- Briefly explain what packet capturing is
- Introduction to the `pnet` library and why you would use it for packet capturing

## Setting up the Environment
- Install Rust, if not already installed
- Create a new Rust project via Cargo
```bash
cargo new pnet_packet_capture
```
- Add `pnet` to your `Cargo.toml`
```toml
[dependencies]
pnet = "0.27"
```

## Finding Network Interfaces
Explain how to list all network interfaces available on the system.

```rust
extern crate pnet;

use pnet::datalink;

fn main() {
    let interfaces = datalink::interfaces();
    for interface in interfaces {
        println!("{:?}", interface);
    }
}
```

## Basic Packet Capture
### Setting up a Data Link Channel
Show how to set up a data link channel.

```rust
use pnet::datalink::{self, Channel::Ethernet};

fn main() {
    let interfaces = datalink::interfaces();
    // Choose an interface
    let interface = interfaces[1].clone();

    let (_, mut rx) = match datalink::channel(&interface, Default::default()) {
        Ok(Ethernet(_, rx)) => rx,
        Err(e) => panic!("An error occurred: {}", e),
    };

    // ... (rest of code)
}
```

### Capturing Packets
Show how to capture packets from the channel.

```rust
loop {
    match rx.next() {
        Ok(packet) => {
            // Do something with the packet data
            println!("Received packet: {:?}", packet);
        },
        Err(e) => {
            // Handle the error
            println!("An error occurred while reading: {}", e);
        }
    }
}
```

## Advanced Topics
### Packet Filtering
Explain how to set up filters to only capture specific types of packets.

### Parsing Captured Packets
Discuss how to parse raw packets into more usable structures, like an `Ipv4Packet`.

## Conclusion
- Summarize key points
- Suggest next steps or other topics to explore
